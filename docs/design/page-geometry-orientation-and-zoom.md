# Page geometry, orientation, and zoom
The document should lay out at a fixed page width, not at the device width.
Ink is stored in page coordinates, so anything that reflows the text while
leaving strokes where they are — rotation, Split View, a different device —
points annotations at the wrong words, and there is no repairing it after the
fact. A fixed column means rotation changes the margins, not the line breaks.

Wanted, and now built (see "Pages" for how):

- **A base width per orientation** — portrait narrower, landscape wider, so
  neither orientation wastes the screen.
- **Pinch to zoom in and out**, the way Notability does it.

Those two requirements pull against ink stability in different amounts, and
the difference decides how much work they are:

- If "a base width per orientation" means two *display scales* over one
  canonical layout width, nothing re-wraps, ink never drifts, and it is the
  same mechanism as pinch zoom — essentially free once zoom exists.
- If it means two *layout widths*, the text re-wraps on every rotation and ink
  drift stops being an edge case. That version is only safe on top of
  text-anchored strokes: anchor each stroke to an `NSTextLocation` plus an
  offset from that paragraph's fragment origin, then translate the stroke group
  on relayout (every PaperKit element has an ID and `applyTransform`).

**Decided, then reversed on measurement:** the zoom container was to be built
before the drawing layer. Measured first, on 12 Sep, it cost TextKit 2 its lazy
layout — see "Who owns scrolling".

**Decided 2026-09-11:** "a base width per orientation" means two *display
scales* over one canonical layout width — not two layout widths. Line breaks
are a function of that one width, so every iPad size, both orientations, Split
View and Stage Manager all wrap identically, a note authored on one device
opens the same on another, and ink stays on the words it was drawn over. It is
also the same mechanism as pinch zoom, so it costs almost nothing once the zoom
container exists.

What that buys is paid for in one place: landscape shows the same text larger
rather than showing more of it. Filling the extra width is then a choice
between raising the display scale and letting the margins grow, and both are
safe for ink, so "neither orientation wastes the screen" becomes a preference
rather than a risk. Below some width — a narrow Split View — scaling down to
fit stops being readable, so the scale wants a floor with horizontal scrolling
past it rather than shrinking indefinitely.

**Built 12 Sep, and made page-based the same evening** (`PageLayout`,
`CanvasGeometry`, `PageView`). A note lays out at its pages' text width — 672pt
for portrait pages, 912pt for landscape — and is drawn at the area's width over
the page's, up to 1.25x, times the reader's pinch zoom (0.5x to 4x). There is no
floor on fitting after all: a landscape page in a portrait iPad fits at about
0.65x, and zoom is how it gets larger. Until 16 Oct the hotbar reserved room on
both sides whichever edge it was on, so moving the bar never resized the text;
see "The page fills the window" for what replaced that.

The page's orientation is the note's, not the device's: rotating the iPad still
changes only the scale. It's chosen when the note is made, from the "+" menu,
and fixed after that (23 Sep): changing it would re-wrap the text and move every
line out from under its ink.

`GeometrySpike` (branch `spike/page-geometry`) answered this and the question is
now closed. Keep the branch for the drift demonstration it also gives.

**Also decided:** text-anchored ink is wanted for its own sake, not only as a
mitigation. That changes the calculus — once strokes are anchored to text, two
layout widths stop being dangerous, so the orientation question becomes a
preference rather than a risk. Sequencing still matters: anchoring is its own
phase and does not fit before the App Store submission.
